Although chrome is a great browser it is not like Firefox in the fact that you can customize it, it is not as slow as people think, it is updated as much as Google chrome, and that it takes less resources.\nwhy use Firefox instead of chrome Libre by libre I mean free and open-source. Not free in the just the sense of money but also the freedom that you can do whatever you want. You can change everything you want. It doesn’t matter what you do. Plugins Google announced that they would be get rid of ad-blockers and other “Bad plugins”. I will say plugin can be bad. Attackers can use plugins to get PII(Personally identifiable information ). If you use the right plugin like ublock origin then you should be fine resources It does not take as much ram(Random Access Memory) to run Firefox then Chrome. How do I install Firefox You can install Firefox at Firefox website or use your Linux package manager Sudo apt install firefox or sudo pacman -S firefox.\nHow do I secure Firefox Although Firefox is a lot better then chrome for security because it 3.29% market share vs 65.27% chrome market share. So if I was an attacker I would have after the 65.27 vs the 3.29 percent of users. I would recommend librewolf for just download and just forget .If people who want to go the extra mile I would recommend Arkenfox User.js. This will really lock down your browser. If you need help with setting it up use Mental Outlaw guide on setting it up or just email me.\nWhat web engine would you recommend? I would recommend searx, there is also the fork of the Searx project called SearXNG, or Duckduckgo. You can use my searXNG instances at rebootcyber.xyz. This search engine are better then Google. Searx is a metasearch engine that talks to Google for you. So you can some what use Google if you want.\nWhat about plugins? ublock origin Decentraleys I don’t care about cookies ",

<p>Firefox is a browser different that the one your are most likely using. It is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundations.
