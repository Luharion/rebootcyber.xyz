# Install script
If you are Artix Linux with runit then you can use what I use for my desktop Linux experience. The script needs
a little bit of work still and I am working on it. There are still somethings that I don't like but I am close
if you want to install it you can go to my [github](https://github.com/Luharion/Lis) or go to my home page on
my website. If you are reading this in the future the script is on my website. Just run the command
`curl -LO rebootcyber.xyz/lis.sh` and it should install then run `./lis.sh`.
## The future plans
1. get the script running it on all Artix Linux init system
2. Arch Linux version
3. custom program list
