# How to Pass The Comptia Network+


# What is the Network+

The CompTIA Network+ is a basic network cert. That goes over some general network stuff. Your companies may need you need to get certification for a promotion.

## What resource use you use?

Professor Messor is a great resources. He goes thorough the objective in order. This could be a good or bad thing depending on your learning style. A another amazing resources is [Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/user/jason-dion/). His video can easily be made into flashcards. This is what I use for flashcards [anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) . His has practice exams. They are good but not like the exam. The exam did not have questions like "Bob is having trouble with getting a IP. What is most likely the issue?" They are still good to do to see what areas you need to work on. You can find deals with his Udemy on the weekend.

If you are having troubles with subnetting like I did then you can use this [resource](https://subnetipv4.com/). The chart he uses is really easy to get and remember. For the exam remember 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256. This is for the amount of host that can be in a subnet. When it comes to what to practice just do /32 - /16. The smaller subnets are good to know but not I did not see it on the exam.

## How long do you need to study for?

This exam has a lot of material. If you do not get network concepts ever well like me. I would say 3-4 months of studying. If you can easy understand network concepts then maybe 2-3 months.

### Based of what I saw on the exam what should you study

Remember this is what type of question I got on the exam. **YOU MAY NOT SEE THIS ON THE EXAM**.

1.  DHCP
2.  Network tools
3.  Network Commands
4.  The OSI model

This concepts was really what I wished I study more but I did not find the time

#### Important notes

You will pass. If you think you will not pass then you will not pass. You got this. **GOOD LUCK**
