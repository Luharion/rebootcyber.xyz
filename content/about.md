# Introduction

I am a nerd, an IT professional, and an aspiring cyber security professional. I enjoy a wide range of IT topics, but my goal is to get into cyber security. I was very fortunate to get into IT. I have about a year and a half experience, I hold the CompTIA A+ 1001 and Network+ n10-008, and I have some projects to tech myself some of the fundamentals. Luckily, I was able to get my foot in the door, and I plan to get it my best shot.


# The reason for this blog

It's my time to give back. A lot of content creators I follow encourage people to put their experience. I do a lot of random projects, why not put it out there and it may help someone so why not. This is also kinda of a selfish reason to because I use this site for documation instead of having my bookmark file being 200 lines.


I would like to thank you for taking the time out of your day to stop by this blog. I hope that you find something useful, and I hope that you can also share your experience as well
